# Student Enrollment Form

This project implements a student enrollment form web application that allows users to enroll students by providing their details. The form is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with responsive design achieved through the Bootstrap framework. The enrolled student's information is dynamically added to a table on form submission using JavaScript. Additionally, images are loaded from URLs submitted in the form, and the website link opens in a new tab when clicked. A fade-in effect achieved through CSS animations enhances the user experience.
